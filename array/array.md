# Key Strategies for Solving Array Problems:

1. Two Pointer Technique: Use two pointers to iterate through the array efficiently, often used for problems involving sorted arrays or finding pairs/triplets.
2. Sliding Window Technique: Use a window of fixed or variable size to traverse the array, useful for problems involving finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions.
3. Hash Maps: Use hash maps to store and retrieve elements efficiently, often used for problems involving frequency counts or finding pairs/triplets.
4. Prefix Sum: Calculate prefix sums to efficiently compute sums of subarrays or ranges.
5. Sorting: Sort the array to simplify the problem or apply algorithms like two pointers or binary search.
