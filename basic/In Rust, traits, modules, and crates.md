# traits, modules, and crates in Rust

## 1. Traits in Rust

A trait is a way to define shared behavior for types. Itâ€™s similar to `interfaces` in languages like Java or TypeScript but with more flexibility. `Traits are used to specify methods that types` (e.g., `structs`, `enums`, etc.) must implement.

> Traits are commonly used for defining shared functionality across different types, `enabling polymorphism`.
