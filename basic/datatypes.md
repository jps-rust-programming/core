# data types in Rust

Rust is a `statically-typed` language, meaning that the type of every variable is known at compile time. Rust offers a rich set of primitive and composite data types, which are categorized into `1. scalar types` and `2. compound types`.

## 1. Scalar Types

Scalar types represent a single value. Rust has four basic scalar types:

- integers
- floating-point numbers,
- booleans, and
- characters.

## 2. Compound Types

Compound types allow you to combine multiple values into one type. Rust has two kinds of compound types:

1. tuples and
2. arrays.
