# Naming conventions in rust

## 1. Snake Case for Variable and Function Names

Rust uses `snake_case` for variables, function names, and other identifiers that are not types or constants. This means all letters are `lowercase`, and words are separated by underscores `(_)`.

**Examples:**

````rust

let my_variable = 42;
fn calculate_total() -> i32 {
    // function body
}
```
