# Error handling in Rust

In Rust, error handling is a fundamental part of the language, and it is done using two primary mechanisms: `Result` and `Option` types. These types allow you to handle errors explicitly, ensuring safety and making the code more robust.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T), // A variant for success, with a value of type T
    Err(E), // A variant for failure, with an error of type E
}
```

- `T` represents the type of the value on success, and `E` represents the type of the error.
